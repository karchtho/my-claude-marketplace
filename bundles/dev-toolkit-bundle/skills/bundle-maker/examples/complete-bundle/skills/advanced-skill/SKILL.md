# Advanced Skill Example

This skill demonstrates a comprehensive skill structure with all optional components: references, examples, and scripts.

## Purpose

Showcase best practices for organizing complex skills:
- Lean SKILL.md (core essentials)
- Detailed documentation in references/
- Working examples in examples/
- Utility scripts in scripts/

## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Progressive Disclosure

Keep SKILL.md lean by moving detailed content to references:

1. Read SKILL.md for core concepts and workflows
2. Consult references for detailed patterns when needed
3. Use examples for working code samples
4. Run scripts for common operations

### Workflow 2: Resource Organization

Organize skill resources by purpose:
- **SKILL.md** - Core concepts, essential workflows (this file)
- **references/** - Detailed documentation loaded as needed
- **examples/** - Working code for copying/adapting
- **scripts/** - Utility scripts for automation

## Additional Resources

### Reference Files

For detailed guidance, consult:
- **`references/detailed-patterns.md`** - Comprehensive implementation patterns
- **`references/advanced-techniques.md`** - Advanced techniques and edge cases
- **`references/api-reference.md`** - Complete API documentation

### Example Files

Working examples in `examples/`:
- **`examples/basic-usage.sh`** - Basic usage example
- **`examples/advanced-config.json`** - Advanced configuration example

### Utility Scripts

Helper scripts in `scripts/`:
- **`scripts/validate.sh`** - Validation utility
- **`scripts/generate.py`** - Code generation script

## Key Principles

1. **Keep SKILL.md lean** - Target 1,500-2,000 words
2. **Move details to references** - Load only when needed
3. **Provide working examples** - Ready to copy/adapt
4. **Create utility scripts** - Automate common operations

## When to Use This Pattern

Use this comprehensive pattern when:
- The skill covers a complex domain
- Detailed documentation is needed
- Multiple variations or frameworks are supported
- Common operations benefit from automation

This pattern ensures minimal context bloat while making detailed information discoverable when needed.
