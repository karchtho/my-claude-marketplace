# Example Skill

This is a minimal skill example demonstrating the simplest possible skill structure.

## Purpose

Demonstrate the minimum requirements for a valid skill:
- YAML frontmatter with name and description
- Markdown body with instructions
- No bundled resources required

## Core Concept

A skill needs only a SKILL.md file to be valid. Everything else (references, examples, scripts) is optional.

## When to Use This Pattern

Use this minimal pattern when:
- The skill provides simple knowledge or guidance
- No complex resources are needed
- Instructions can fit in a single file under 2,000 words

## Example Usage

This skill would trigger when a user asks:
- "Show me a minimal skill example"
- "Demonstrate basic skill structure"
- "What's the simplest skill possible?"
